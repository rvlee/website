	  	<h2>Something about me!</h2>
	  	<p>Hi, I was born in Houson, Texas, then moved back to Taiwan to study, then back to the states for college. After graduation I moved back to Taiwan then to Indonesia to work as an systems specialist and analyst for just a little over a year and now I am temporarily living in London, UK! (just until after new years) Zalora is a ecommerce company set up all around in south east Asia, sponsored by Rocket Internet from Germany. It's popularity is rising from it's relatively cheap prices and decent quality + simple shipping transactions! I got the chance to work as an operation department head and learned more about this market.</p>

	  	<h2>Something Quirky?!</h2>
	  	<p>This might sound like a no brainer but I realized, that the Computer proccessor and whether the hard disk is a SSD or not
          really matters. Before, I didnt really think much of SSD and the difference between a Core i5 and Core i7, but because i
          had to process large amounts of data on excel, the normal harddisk just could not run excel. So my boss gave me a i7
          SSD laptop and would run so smoothly. I guess the surprise in this is that know I know who buys the best spec computers,
          besides gamers. I used to think, just an average spec computer is enough but it really changed my perspective after
          working. I really had no idea.
          Also, www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned is a really interesting page to read while you're bored or just want to learn something
          Page 3
          new. It might not be useful, but definitely interesting!</a>. </p>

  	 <h2>Why DBC?</h2>
  	   <p>I have taken some classes here and there in College. I found those classes to be very interesting, far more than Business.
          But it was too late because I could not change majors anymore. So I took classes on introductory C, but could not take
          advanced classes because I was not in the major.</p>
